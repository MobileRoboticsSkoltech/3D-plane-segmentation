quickhull_3_demo
----------------

This demo program illustrates the 3D version of the quickhull algorithm.
The user supplies a non-negative integer value indicating the number 
of points to be generated.  The points are drawn randomly from a sphere
of a certain radius and the resulting hull of the points is displayed 
in a Geomview window.  

To get the hull centered in the geomview window, you 
should use the "Look" button in the Geomview controls.
