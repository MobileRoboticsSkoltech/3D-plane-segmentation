Overview
--------

This source code package contains our C++ implementation of the AHC based fast plane extraction for organized point cloud (point cloud that can be indexed as an image). There are three folders in this package:

* include

    Our C++ implementation of the algorithm with dependencies on OpenCV and shared_ptr (from C++11 or Boost).

* cpp

    Two example C++ console applications using our algorithm to extract planes from Kinect-like point cloud (depends on PCL), with a CMake script to help generating project files.

* matlab

    A matlab interface (fitAHCPlane.m) through MEX for using our algorithm in matlab. We also provide a wrapper class Kinect.m and kinect_ahc.m to do real-time plane extraction in matlab, partially depends on a 3rd-party toolbox [Kinect_Matlab].

Version

1.0

Installation
------------

##### C++ example

1. Install OpenCV, Boost and PCL (If you install PCL using their all-in-one installer, you directly get Boost installed as well).

2. Generate project file using CMake under either Windows or Linux.

3. Compile.

4. Run the compiled process: plane_fitter (first connect a Kinect to your computer!) or plane_fitter_pcd (first modify plane_fitter_pcd.ini accordingly!).

5. Enjoy!

##### Matlab example

1. In matlab:
```
cd WHERE_YOU_EXTRACT_THE_PACKAGE/matlab/mex
```

2. Run makefile.m

3. Select the directories for *OpenCV_Include*, *OpenCV_Lib*, and *Boost_Include* respectively

4. If everything compiles smoothly:
```
cd ..
```

5. Load a single frame we've prepared for you in matlab by:
```
load frame
```

6. Run our algorithm on the point cloud:
```
frame.mbs=fitAHCPlane(frame.xyz);
viewSeg(frame.mbs,640,480)
```

7. Enjoy!

8. If you want to play with the kinect_ahc.m with a Kinect, install [Kinect_Matlab] first.
